For geographically separated cyber-physical systems, state estimation at a remote monitoring or control site is important to ensure stability and reliability of the system. Often for safety or commercial reasons it is necessary to ensure confidentiality of the process state and control information. A current topic of interest is the private transmission of confidential state information. Many transmission encoding schemes rely on acknowledgments, which may be susceptible to interference from an adversary. We consider a stealthy intruder that selectively blocks acknowledgments allowing an eavesdropper to obtain a reliable state estimate defeating an encoding scheme. We utilize Bayesian Quickest Change Detection techniques to quickly detect online the presence of an intruder at both the remote transmitter and receiver.
