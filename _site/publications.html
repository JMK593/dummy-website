<p>Cooperative adaptive cruise control presents an opportunity to improve road transportation through increase in road capacity and reduction in energy use and accidents. Clever design of control algorithms and communication systems is required to ensure that the vehicle platoon is stable and meets desired safety requirements. In this paper, we propose a centralized model predictive controller for a heterogeneous platoon of vehicles to reach a desired platoon velocity and individual inter-vehicle distances with driver-selected headway time. In our approach, we allow for interruption from a human driver in the platoon that temporarily takes control of their vehicle with the assumption that the driver will, at minimum, obey legal velocity limits and the physical performance constraints of their vehicle. The finite horizon cost function of our proposed platoon controller is inspired from the infinite horizon design. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first platoon controller that integrates human-driven vehicles. We illustrate the performance of our proposed design with a numerical study.</p>

<p>For geographically separated cyber-physical systems, state estimation at a remote monitoring or control site is important to ensure stability and reliability of the system. Often for safety or commercial reasons it is necessary to ensure confidentiality of the process state and control information. A current topic of interest is the private transmission of confidential state information. Many transmission encoding schemes rely on acknowledgments, which may be susceptible to interference from an adversary. We consider a stealthy intruder that selectively blocks acknowledgments allowing an eavesdropper to obtain a reliable state estimate defeating an encoding scheme. We utilize Bayesian Quickest Change Detection techniques to quickly detect online the presence of an intruder at both the remote transmitter and receiver.</p>
